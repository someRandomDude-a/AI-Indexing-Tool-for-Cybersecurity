# The Goal:
* Index the use of AI in tools
* Index the difficulty of implementing each tool
* Index each tools importance for security
* Display a combined score for adoption of AI tools
* Display a combiend score to show L0 to L4
#### Make a roadmap for improvement in security and adoption of tools according TO their implementation difficulty and implementation value

## How to Index the use of AI?
 * Research
   * Using deep research AI tools
   * Consulting Industry Experts
   * Self report from maintainer of the tools
   * ~~Reading of Source code for the tools~~
   * Scrape and aggregate data from existing Indexes
 * Combine these parameters too make mark them with a common scoring pattern (AI score, Importance Score, Implementation difficulty score) 
 * Make a summary on how AI is actually used in each tool and how it helps protect infrastructure
 * Display these options for users too select

## How to use this too Index the adoption in AI in a company / system
### Companies are unlikely too openly share their security architecture 
#### Information is power and knowing the excact tools used and how they are implemented would allow *Attackers* to easily focus their efforts 

##
### The Solution?
#### An easy to use tool that allows any system administrator too quickly enter the details of their setup too see how they compare and roadmap.
#### Importantly, everything entered is only used localy too minimize the risk of data leak as much as possible.
## Trust
### The tool must be open source for anyone to inspect before using it.
